This is a basic extension for Zed to enable F# features.

## Prerequisites
You must have `fsautocomplete` installed, which you can do by running `dotnet tool install --global fsautocomplete`.

## Installation

Inside your [plugin directory](https://zed.dev/docs/extensions/installing-extensions#installation-location), run:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:nathanjcollins/zed-fsharp.git installed/fsharp
```

You can update the plugin to a pre-release version in the Zed installed plugin tab.

Feel free to contribute.
